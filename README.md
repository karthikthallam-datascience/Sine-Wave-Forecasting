# Sine-Wave-Forecasting
Forecasting on a Sequential Data like Sine wave using Recurrent Neural Network(RNN)

1) Data is generated using Numpy 

2) Train/Test split:

    a) Taking out 1% of the data from train_set to be a test data
    
3) Scaling on both train and test data

4) Batch generator:

    a) TimeSeriesGenerator class will create bacthes from train data for training processes off of it
    
    
5) Creating the model with SimpleRNN, LSTM and compare the results
